# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to upload a picture of food on a scale and automatically receive nutrition information. The system will use computer vision to detect the food type and read the scale weight, then calculate and return accurate nutrition values based on the identified food and its measured weight.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a health-conscious user, I want to upload a photo of food on a scale, so that I can quickly get accurate nutrition information without manual input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL accept common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
2. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate the image contains both food and a scale
3. IF the image is invalid or unclear THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages
4. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically detect what food is in my image, so that I don't have to manually specify the food type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image contains food THEN the system SHALL identify the food type and present the top result to the user
2. WHEN food is detected THEN the system SHALL show the recognized food name for user confirmation
3. WHEN the detected food is incorrect THEN the system SHALL provide alternative food suggestions from the detection results
4. IF none of the suggested foods are correct THEN the system SHALL allow manual food entry through a searchable database
5. WHEN multiple food items are detected THEN the system SHALL handle each food item separately with individual confirmation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to read the weight from the scale in my photo, so that nutrition calculations are based on the actual portion size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image contains a digital scale display THEN the system SHALL extract the weight reading and present it to the user
2. WHEN the scale shows weight in different units THEN the system SHALL handle grams, ounces, and pounds
3. WHEN weight is detected THEN the system SHALL display the extracted weight for user confirmation
4. IF the detected weight is incorrect THEN the system SHALL allow the user to manually input the correct weight
5. IF the scale reading is unclear or unreadable THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to enter weight manually

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive detailed nutrition information for my food, so that I can track my dietary intake accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN food type and weight are determined THEN the system SHALL calculate calories, macronutrients, and key micronutrients
2. WHEN displaying nutrition data THEN the system SHALL show calories, protein, carbohydrates, fat, fiber, and sodium at minimum
3. WHEN nutrition data is unavailable for a food THEN the system SHALL indicate missing information clearly
4. WHEN calculations are complete THEN the system SHALL present results in an easy-to-read format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web app to be responsive and fast, so that I can use it efficiently on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the app on mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL be fully responsive and touch-friendly
2. WHEN uploading images THEN the processing time SHALL not exceed 30 seconds under normal conditions
3. WHEN the app loads THEN it SHALL be functional within 3 seconds on standard internet connections
4. WHEN using the camera feature THEN users SHALL be able to take photos directly within the app

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add multiple food ingredients sequentially to the same scale and track each addition separately, so that I can build complex meals and get nutrition information for each component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have a previous scale reading stored THEN the system SHALL allow me to upload a new image with additional food
2. WHEN new food is added to the scale THEN the system SHALL detect only the newly added food items
3. WHEN calculating weight for new food THEN the system SHALL subtract the previous total weight from the current total weight
4. WHEN multiple ingredients are added sequentially THEN the system SHALL maintain a running total of all ingredients and their individual nutrition values
5. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL display both individual ingredient nutrition and cumulative totals
6. IF the new total weight is less than or equal to the previous weight THEN the system SHALL alert the user of a potential error
7. WHEN building a multi-ingredient meal THEN users SHALL be able to continue adding ingredients until they choose to finalize the meal
8. WHEN a meal is finalized THEN the system SHALL provide complete nutrition breakdown for the entire meal

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to review and correct any detection errors, so that my nutrition information is accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN food or weight detection occurs THEN the system SHALL allow users to verify and edit results
2. WHEN corrections are needed THEN users SHALL be able to manually select food types from a searchable database
3. WHEN weight readings are incorrect THEN users SHALL be able to input the correct weight manually
4. WHEN changes are made THEN the nutrition calculations SHALL update automatically
